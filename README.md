This repository contains the code, dataset, and final research paper for a machine learning project focused on predicting community crime risk levels. The project implements a dual-model framework to separately classify violent and non-violent crime, optimizing for a real-world public safety objective rather than generic accuracy.

## üìñ Project Overview

This study presents a comprehensive machine learning framework for classifying community crime levels by strategically distinguishing between violent and non-violent offenses. Utilizing the "Communities and Crime" dataset, a dual-model architecture is implemented to separately predict risk categories, validating the hypothesis that their socio-economic drivers are distinct.

The project's primary contribution is its **objective-driven optimization**. Instead of maximizing simple accuracy, the models were tuned to maximize **recall for the "high-risk" category**. This approach is critical in a public safety context, as the cost of a false negative (failing to identify a high-risk community) is substantially higher than that of a false positive.

The final models serve as powerful, practical tools for data-driven policy-making and resource allocation, achieving exceptional performance in identifying at-risk communities.

### ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Dual-Model Architecture:** Uses separate, specialized models (**XGBoost** for violent crime, **LightGBM** for non-violent crime) to capture the unique drivers of each crime type.
-   **Objective-Driven Tuning:** The entire optimization pipeline prioritizes maximizing recall for the high-risk class, achieving **99% recall for violent crime** and **94% recall for non-violent crime**.
-   **Advanced Feature Selection:** Employs Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) to identify the most impactful socio-economic predictors for each model.
-   **Comprehensive Analysis:** The entire workflow, from data imputation and feature engineering to model validation, is documented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook and research paper.
